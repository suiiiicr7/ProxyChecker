## Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

**1. Load Proxies**
   - Click "Load Proxies" button in the Checker tab
   - Select your proxy list file (.txt format)
   - Choose the appropriate input format from the dropdown menu
   - Enable "Remove Duplicates" if needed

**2. Configure Settings**
   - Select proxy type: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, or SOCKS5
   - Set timeout value in seconds (default: 10)
   - Enable/disable "Check Speed" option
   - Choose output format for exports
   - Select sorting preference

**3. Start Checking**
   - Click "Start Check" to begin verification
   - Monitor real-time progress in the status bar
   - View results in the table with color-coded status:
     - Green = Working proxy
     - Red = Failed proxy
   - Use "Stop Check" to halt the process if needed

**4. Export Results**
   - Click "Save as CSV" for detailed reports with all columns
   - Click "Save as TXT" for a simple list of working proxies only

### Input File Format

Create a text file with your proxies, one per line. The application supports multiple formats:

```text
192.168.1.1:8080
10.0.0.1:3128:username:password
username:password:proxy.example.com:8080
203.0.113.5 8080
```

### Settings Configuration

Navigate to the **Settings** tab to customize:

- **Test URL**: Website used to verify proxy connectivity (default: https://www.google.com)
- **Speed Test URL**: File URL for download speed measurement (default: 100KB test file)
- **Default Timeout**: Maximum wait time per proxy in seconds
- **Concurrent Checks**: Thread count for parallel checking (display only in current version)
- **Verification Method**: 
  - HTTP Request: Full functionality test with actual web request
  - Socket Connection: Basic port connectivity test

## Use Cases

- **Web Scraping**: Find and validate reliable proxies for data collection projects
- **Privacy Testing**: Test proxy anonymity levels and connection speeds
- **Proxy Management**: Maintain and validate large proxy lists efficiently
- **Network Administration**: Verify proxy server functionality and performance
- **Security Research**: Test proxy configurations and security settings
- **Bot Development**: Source working proxies for automation tasks

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Test URLs

You can specify custom URLs in the Settings tab to test proxies against specific websites or services:
- Social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
- E-commerce sites (Amazon, eBay)
- API endpoints
- Geo-restricted content services
- Corporate intranets

### Speed Test Customization

Modify the speed test URL to use different file sizes based on your needs:
- **Small files (100KB)**: Quick speed checks, suitable for large proxy lists
- **Medium files (1-5MB)**: Balanced testing for moderate accuracy
- **Large files (10MB+)**: Accurate speed measurement, takes longer per proxy

### Output Format Options

Choose from multiple output formats:
- **IP:PORT** - Standard format
- **IP PORT** - Space-separated
- **IP,PORT** - Comma-separated (CSV compatible)

## Output Details

### CSV Export Format

The CSV export includes comprehensive information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| IP | IP address of the proxy (with auth username if applicable) |
| Port | Port number |
| Type | Proxy type (HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS4/SOCKS5) |
| Country | Detected country via geolocation |
| Speed (KB/s) | Download speed measurement |
| Response Time | Time to establish connection |
| Status | Working or Failed with error details |

### TXT Export Format

Simple text file containing only working proxies in the selected output format:
```text
192.168.1.1:8080
10.0.0.1:3128
203.0.113.5:8080
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Proxies showing as "Failed" even though they are known to work
- **Solution 1**: Increase timeout value in settings (try 15-30 seconds)
- **Solution 2**: Switch verification method from HTTP Request to Socket Connection
- **Solution 3**: Check if the test URL is accessible from your location
- **Solution 4**: Some proxies may require specific authentication formats

**Issue**: Country shows as "Unknown" for all proxies
- **Solution 1**: Verify your internet connection is active
- **Solution 2**: Check if ip-api.com is accessible from your network
- **Solution 3**: Some private IP addresses won't have geolocation data
- **Solution 4**: API rate limiting may occur with very large proxy lists

**Issue**: Speed test shows "N/A" for all proxies
- **Solution 1**: Ensure the speed test URL is accessible and returns data
- **Solution 2**: Increase timeout value as slow proxies may timeout
- **Solution 3**: Disable speed checking if not needed to speed up verification
- **Solution 4**: Some proxies block file downloads

**Issue**: Application window not displaying correctly
- **Solution 1**: Verify minimum screen resolution (1200x700)
- **Solution 2**: Check display scaling settings in your OS
- **Solution 3**: Try maximizing the window

**Issue**: Application not starting or crashes on launch
- **Solution 1**: Verify Python 3.6+ is installed: `python --version`
- **Solution 2**: Check tkinter availability: `python -m tkinter`
- **Solution 3**: On Linux, install tkinter: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- **Solution 4**: Check console for error messages

**Issue**: Checking process is very slow
- **Solution 1**: Reduce timeout value for faster checking
- **Solution 2**: Disable speed checking if not needed
- **Solution 3**: Use Socket Connection method instead of HTTP Request
- **Solution 4**: Check proxy list for invalid entries
